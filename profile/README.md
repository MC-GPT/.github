## 📌 Abstract
Our team is focusing on providing an application service for making up the mood of parties that are hosted at homes and shared spaces. We plan developing lighting & appliance control, multiplayer games and space management functions, available to all participants for an entertaining party.
We came up with the idea “MC GPT” as we thought of a solution that could release the burden of party hosts and make the party more memorable. Party hosts have many factors to consider such as the lighting of the space, temperature, contents of the party, music and many others. To reduce these tasks focused on the host, our team developed three main functions.<br>
First, “MC GPT” has the function to register and control various appliances at any place. For example, lighting devices can be adjusted in color and brightness; other appliances can be adjusted accordingly, such as temperature control of air conditioners. Moreover, we use generative AI to suggest and change the color and brightness of lights according to user inputs.<br>
Another function is providing multiplayer mini-games that can be enjoyed with mobile devices of participants. Playing the game involves one game host and other participants. The host can see the questions along with answers of the games, answering orders of participants and moving on to the next games. Participants can view questions of the games and are also provided with an answering button that checks order based on the speed of pressing the button.<br>
Finally, space owners can control their spaces by using a unique code generated by the application. These codes can be distributed to other participants which allows them to gain access to all the appliances and games. Importantly, the code can be refreshed which prohibits access from outdated codes.<br>
In conclusion, our team hopes to provide appliance control along with a game function that will reduce the tasks required by party hosts, resulting in a more seamless party and help all participants leave with a memorable party experience.
